# House Price Prediction using Regression

## Description
This project focuses on predicting house prices using various regression models. The dataset includes several features that are used to predict the target variable (house price). Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented and evaluated to select the best model for accurate predictions.

## Features
The project utilizes the following machine learning models:
- **Linear Regression**
- **SGD Regressor**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

## Installation
To run this project locally, you need to install the required dependencies. You can install them by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dependencies
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
- `joblib`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in sequence to train the models and evaluate their performance.

## Results
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score. The goal is to minimize the error and maximize the R² score to achieve the most accurate predictions.

## Contributors
This project was developed as part of a machine learning regression exercise for house price prediction.
